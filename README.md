# Test-Environments-Planing

I developped This webapp in order to manage the booking of test environments and have a quick and esay visibility on it.
This version is not the final version as it is still under development.

# How it works ?
First things first, the environment manager has to define the environments and the related applications.
This is done with the help of the default django administration portal.
Once these entities are defined, the application is configured and can be used.
